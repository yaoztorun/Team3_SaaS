## 📈 Part 4: Analysis Guidelines

### UTAUT Calculation Method

**All questions are positively worded** (no reverse coding needed). Higher scores = better acceptance.

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:

**For each participant:**

1. **Performance Expectancy (PE):**
   - Add scores from PE questions 1-4
   - Divide by 4
   - Example: (5 + 4 + 4 + 5) ÷ 4 = 4.5

2. **Effort Expectancy (EE):**
   - Add scores from EE questions 1-4
   - Divide by 4
   - Example: (4 + 5 + 4 + 4) ÷ 4 = 4.25

3. **Social Influence (SI):**
   - Add scores from SI questions 1-4
   - Divide by 4
   - Example: (3 + 4 + 3 + 4) ÷ 4 = 3.5

4. **Facilitating Conditions (FC):**
   - Add scores from FC questions 1-4
   - Divide by 4
   - Example: (5 + 4 + 3 + 4) ÷ 4 = 4.0

5. **Behavioral Intention (BI):**
   - Add scores from BI questions 1-3
   - Divide by 3
   - Example: (4 + 4 + 5) ÷ 3 = 4.33

**Across all participants (N = number of users):**

1. Calculate each dimension's mean across all users
2. Calculate standard deviation for each dimension
3. Report: Mean (SD)

**Example with 3 users:**

| User | PE   | EE   | SI  | FC  | BI   |
|------|------|------|-----|-----|------|
| 1    | 4.5  | 4.25 | 3.5 | 4.0 | 4.33 |
| 2    | 4.0  | 4.5  | 3.0 | 3.5 | 4.0  |
| 3    | 4.75 | 4.0  | 4.0 | 4.25| 4.67 |
| **Mean** | **4.42** | **4.25** | **3.50** | **3.92** | **4.33** |

#### Interpretation Benchmarks:

- **5.0 - 4.5:** Excellent (Strong acceptance)
- **4.49 - 4.0:** Good (Positive acceptance)
- **3.99 - 3.5:** Moderate (Cautious acceptance)
- **3.49 - 3.0:** Neutral (On the fence)
- **< 3.0:** Poor (Rejection/redesign needed)

#### Target Scores:
- **Minimum:** All dimensions > 3.0 (above neutral)
- **Goal:** PE and EE > 4.0 (users find it useful AND easy)
- **Ideal:** BI > 4.0 (strong intention to use)

### Task Success Metrics:
1. **Completion rate:** % of users who complete each task
2. **Time to complete:** Average time per task
3. **Error rate:** # of errors/wrong paths per task
4. **Satisfaction:** Post-task rating (1-5 scale)

## 🚀 Good Luck!

Your app has excellent analytics infrastructure. Now measure if users can actually complete the northstar actions and if they intend to keep using it. Focus on:
- **Can they do it?** (Task success rates)
- **Do they like it?** (UTAUT scores > 3.0)
- **Will they use it?** (Behavioral Intention scores)
