## Research Methodology Framework

### What will you research and how?

This framework helps you think about different types of data collection:

#### Objective vs. Subjective Data

**Objective Quantitative Data:**
- **Logs/metrics** (*****) - App analytics, usage data, behavioral metrics
  - What logs/metrics will you track?
  - Examples: Login frequency, feature usage, completion rates, pirate metrics

**Objective Qualitative Data:**
- **Observations** (****) - Watching users interact with the app
  - What behaviors/actions will you observe?
  - Examples: Hesitations, errors, facial expressions, verbal reactions

**Subjective Quantitative Data:**
- **Validated scales** (*) - Standardized questionnaires
  - Which scales?
  - Examples: User Engagement Scale, AttrakDiff, IMI, Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction Scale
  - Google Scholar is your friend!
  
- **Custom items** (**) - Questions you create
  - What items will you ask participants to fill out?
  - Must be carefully designed to avoid bias

**Subjective Qualitative Data:**
- **Interviews** (***) - Conversations with users
  - What questions will you ask?
  - Examples: "What motivated you to use this feature?", "How did you feel when...?"

### Key Considerations:

**Quantitative vs. Qualitative:**
- Quantitative: Numbers, statistics, generalizable
- Qualitative: Rich descriptions, context, understanding "why"

**Objective vs. Subjective:**
- Objective: Observable, measurable, less bias
- Subjective: Perceptions, opinions, experiences

**Best Practice:**
- Use mixed methods for triangulation
- Combine objective logs with subjective feedback
- Use both quantitative scales and qualitative interviews
