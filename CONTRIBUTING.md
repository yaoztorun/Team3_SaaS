# Contributing Guidelines ü§ù

Thank you for contributing to **Cocktail Companion**!  
This guide describes how we collaborate, name branches, and ensure clean commits.

<br>

## Branching Strategy

We follow a simplified **Git flow** with two long-lived branches that correspond to our environments.

### Main/long-lived Branches

| Branch | Environment | Purpose |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **main** | **Production** | Stable, deployment-ready code. What users actually use. |
| **develop** | **Development** | Active development and integration. Used for internal testing. |

<br>

### Feature Branch Workflow

All new work happens on **short-lived feature branches** created from `develop`.  
Each feature branch focuses on a single change ‚Äî a feature, fix, or improvement.

**Flow:**
1. **Start from `develop`:**  
   Create a branch using the naming convention  
   ‚Üí `feature/backend-add-login-endpoint`
2. **Work locally:**  
   Code, commit, and test the feature.
3. **Push & open a Pull Request (PR):**  
   Merge the feature branch into `develop` once it‚Äôs complete and reviewed.
4. **Automatic/Manual Deploy (Dev Environment):**  
   Every merge into `develop` can trigger deployment to a **development environment** (if available) for internal testing.
5. **Stabilize and Merge to Production:**  
   When `develop` is tested and stable, merge it into `main`.  
   This deploys the final version to **production**.

<br>

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create new feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout -b feature/frontend-login-screen

# 2. Work, commit, push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add login screen UI"
git push origin feature/frontend-login-screen

# 3. Open PR ‚Üí merge into develop
# 4. When develop is stable:
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main
```
<br>

## Branch Naming Convention

Every new branch needs to follow given structure:
```
<type>/<area>-<short-description>
```
Some examples are:
```
feature/frontend-login-page
feature/backend-auth-endpoint
bugfix/database-schema-error
refactor/frontend-navbar
```
The different types and areas we work with in this project are shown in the tables below

#### Type

| Type | Explanation | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **feature** | Used when adding a new feature or functionality. | `feature/frontend-rating-system` |
| **bugfix** | Fixes a bug found during development or testing. | `bugfix/backend-auth-token` |
| **refactor** | Improves existing code structure without changing functionality. | `refactor/frontend-input-validation` |
| **chore** | Routine maintenance tasks like updating dependencies or configs. | `chore/update-eslint-config` |
| **test** | Adds or updates test cases. | `test/api-cocktail-endpoints` |
| **docs** | Documentation changes only. | `docs/update-readme` |

#### Area

| Area | Explanation | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **frontend** | UI, React components, styling, or client-side logic. | `feature/frontend-login-page` |
| **backend** | Node.js API, Express routes, business logic, or controllers. | `feature/backend-add-rating-endpoint` |
| **database** | Database schema, migrations, or seed data updates. | `bugfix/database-add-cocktail-table` |
| **api** | Interfaces or integrations with external/internal APIs. | `feature/api-cocktaildb-integration` |
<br>

**Tip:**  
Keep branch names **short but descriptive**, all lowercase, and use **hyphens** instead of spaces.
